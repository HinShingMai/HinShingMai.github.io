            <p>The study has been suspended because we detected significant lag during the experiment.</p>
            <p>This experiment requires a fast computer to display browser animations smoothly. We regret to inform you that your current device might be insufficient for the task.</p>
            <p>For our research, we require participants to have similar frame rates during the experiment to ensure that the data is comparable.</p>
            <p>Using a slow computer and having a low frame rate will also cause the experiment to take much longer to complete.</p>
            <p>You can try closing background apps and unnecessary browser windows. Then, refresh the page and try again. You can also try using a different laptop if you have one.</p>
            <p>You can also leave the study via this link: <a href="https://app.prolific.com/submissions/complete?cc=CNY5AF0A">Completion Code: CNY5AF0A</a>. We will treat you as being Screened Out and you will be paid a partial compensation for your time.</p>
            <p>We're sorry for this inconvenience.</p>

            <p>In our experiment, We study the learning process of participants on a motor task.</p>
            <p>Taking long breaks between learning sessions will interfere with the learning process.</p>
